### Description

*Mapping for the Urban Humanities* is an intensive institute on digital mapping designed for faculty and advanced graduate students at Columbia University. It is offered through the Center for Spatial Research at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation with support from the Office of the Dean of Humanities.

This hands-on workshop course is intended to broaden and transform the disciplinary locations within which data analysis takes place. This course will introduce participants to open-source mapping software, QGIS, to methods of data collection and creation, and to approaches and concepts in critical spatial analysis. Throughout the week we will be joined by external faculty for workshops and seminars around specific examples of projects and courses that apply spatial data analytic tools to address humanistic questions.

The course condenses major topics from a semester long introductory GIS course into a six-day hands-on intensive with two days of structured practicum. Skills based tutorials draw on diverse datasets relevant to investigations in the urban humanities.

With support from the course’s three instructors, participating faculty will incorporate newly-acquired spatial analysis skills into course assignments and syllabi as well as research plans.

### Structure and Rhythm:
From May 28, 2019 – June 3, 2019 the course will meet from on weekdays 10am-5:30pm in an intensive workshop and lab format. Each day will be divided into roughly three parts: skills-based tutorials where participants will learn critical methods in digital mapping and data collection through the use of open-source software (QGIS), workshops on the course or project that participants applied to the course with, and seminar or workshop sessions focused on research or teaching practices related to the urban humanities.
Thursday, June 6 (from 1-4:30pm) will be dedicated to presentations by participants about the course or research project they have worked on during the intensive.

On June 4 & 5 participants will have the opportunity to work in a supported lab environment and meet one on one with course instructors (however attendance is not required on these days).



### Course Goals:
The course aims to equip participants with a grasp of the methods and methodologies of Geographic Information Systems so that they can introduce critical spatial pedagogies into their teaching and research. Through the course participants will:
*	Develop robust familiarity with QGIS and its functions
*	Gain fluency with foundational GIS concepts (including how the GIS data model abstracts geographic phenomena)
*	Understand GIS spatial data types and the kinds of analysis that are possible with each
*	Create new spatial datasets using data creation methods integral to GIS
*	Define spatially-driven research questions
*	Identify and analyze key data sources relevant to their field
*	Understand how to learn more about specific GIS methods relevant to a research project
*	Develop data-driven urban humanities courses and assignments
*	Gain fluency in basic methodology design for spatially driven research projects
*	Become a part of and foster a community of scholars at Columbia University working on space and with tools of critical mapping



### Materials
* Laptop with QGIS 3.4.7 installed (see instructions [here](/Resources/DownloadingQGIS.md))
* In addition to printed copies distributed on the first day, all course tutorials are available via Github in this repository
* A three button mouse (optional, though *highly* encouraged)
* Optional: a 16 GB flash drive to store course data + exercises

## Background on CSR
The Center for Spatial Research was established in 2015 as a hub for urban research that links design, architecture, urbanism, the humanities and data science. It sponsors research and curricular activities built around new technologies of mapping, data visualization, data collection, and data analysis. CSR focuses on data literacy as well as interrogating the world of 'big data,' working to open up new areas of urban research and inquiry.

Our projects generally involve collaborations with researchers and advocates across a variety of disciplines and institutions, working with them to communicate information clearly, critically, responsibly, and provocatively. We are committed to rigorous and reliable work with data; to harnessing the most powerful techniques of design and visualization; and to a critical reflection on the limits and ideologies of both data and its representation. Based in the disciplines of design, architecture and urbanism we make links with and bring spatial expertise to the humanities as well as the sciences.
